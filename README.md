# Sound Wave Simulation

A Python-based project to simulate sound waves, visualize their waveforms, analyze frequency spectra, and simulate resonance effects.

## Features
- Generate sine waves of different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.
- Visualize waveforms and frequency spectra.
- Simulate resonance effects by combining multiple frequencies.
